This repo is apps for setting custom baudrates for uarts on linux. I was a little surprised when stty wouldnt allow me to set custom baudrate so I patched it so that it can. Probly a very good reason why they dont let you but I dunno what it is. Also a stand alone cli app, compile with "gcc -o cbaud cbaud.c" and make sure the termios.h file is in same directory. I had also wanted to play around with gtkdialogs ability to be added to C programs so a gui app is here as well. You need to compile/install gtkdialog first then the baud gui app. If writing an app etc of your own, for sum reason several tio parts are defined multiple times in multiple headers, headers often (as in this case) are required to  be used together. This causes errors/failed compiles. I have no idea why its setup this way so I simply took the termios.h removed the redefined parts and use that instead (shakes head).
